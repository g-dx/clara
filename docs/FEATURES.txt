(Hopefully these are in the order they should be tackled...)

- support arrays of int, bool, string (all 8 bytes in size)

- support function with same name but different signatures

- dynamic string implementation

- Add utility functions for basic types into some sort of standard library

- support passing functions as parameters

- support anonymous functions/closures

- add single register stack machine in code gen
- add short circuit boolean code gen

- full register usage in code gen

- support escape analysis for stack allocation

DONE:

- support empty return
- support variables
