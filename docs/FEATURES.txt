(Hopefully these are in the order they should be tackled...)

- support modules
- Add utility functions for basic types into some sort of standard library
- Add support for anonymous functions
- Add support for closures
- add single register stack machine in code gen
- add short circuit boolean code gen
- full register usage in code gen
- support escape analysis for stack allocation

DONE:

- support empty return
- support variables
- support "external" functions (i.e. implementation provided at link time)
- support function with same name but different signatures
- dynamic string implementation
- support arrays of int & string (all 8 bytes in size)
- support passing functions as parameters
- support a standard library
