- Type check variadic function calls
- Ensure all matching is exhaustive. To support ignoring cases we are not interested in a new 'remaining'
keyword will likely be required.
- Add byte support for bitwise operators.
- Update ASM generation to produce PIE executables.
- Generic call sites within other generic functions require type parameters to match between functions
- Generic closures require type parameters to be declared again
