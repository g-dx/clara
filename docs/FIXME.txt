- Ensure functions which return something terminate properly.
- Ensure struct constructors cannot be overridden.
- Ensure built-in functions cannot be overridden. To do this we should "namespace" all function names by prefixing with "clara_"
- Type check function calls (Maybe also provide a way to disable this as it is handy for experimentation)
- Type check arithmetic operators (more generally, define operator rules better or more succinctly)
- Position information for invalid operands always assume "left" is to blame.
