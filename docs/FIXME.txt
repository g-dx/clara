- Array length fields should be readonly
- Type check variadic function calls
- []byte & []int should *not* be interchangeable when matching method signatures.
- Fix scoping for variables containing functions which shadow same name of global function. In the example below the first call
to cube(3) will yield a nil type for the funcCall node. This because it resolves the identifier symbol from the line below (it
was added during the parse and is in scope) but does not have a type yet because we obviously haven't reached that line yet.

fn main() {
  printf("%d\n", cube(3)) // Should print 27
  cube = double
  printf("%d\n", cube(3)) // Should print 6
}

This problem is fundamentally caused by added symbols during the parse.
