- Type check variadic function calls
- Add byte support for bitwise operators.
- Allow panic() to operate as a return statement
- Add boolean short circuiting
- Update ASM generation to produce PIE executables. This will allow passing external functions as parameters
- Generic call sites within other generic functions require type parameters to match between functions
- Generic closures require type parameters to be declared again
- Compiler crash:
    fn closure«T»(t: T) fn() T = fn() = t

- Properly identify external function using a directive. E.g
#[Ext]
fn libc()

And update tagging rules appropriately. This will be required for
HTTP server work

- Start to define a higher level interface for AsmWriter
- Remove lots of tagging and untagging from expression handling
- Introduce an "any" type & update printf & friends
- Investigate exactly why "fn printByte(b: byte)" is disabled
